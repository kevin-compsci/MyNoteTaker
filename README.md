MyNoteTaker -- LabVIEW 2013 Project

This LabVIEW project implements basic file operations and handles reading of pdf file formats (more formats possibly later). However, this project will be unable to continue until I secure a version of LabVIEW to use (LabVIEW is not free, and every iteration of LabVIEW may be different from previous versions). LabVIEW programs may only run on your system if you have the LabVIEW runtime environment or development kit installed (refer to National Instruments for more information).
